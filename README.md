# configuration-files

In this repo I will upload files that are often used in my projects. Please consider that these are just examples. Adjust the config files and scripts to your own needs and requirements.

To get a copy of each file, click on the `raw` button,  get the pure link and curl them into your current project directory, e.g.:

```
# output to file using own filename

$ curl -XGET -o filename.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1000miles/configuration-files/master/README.md
```

or:
```
# output to file using the same filename

$ curl -XGET -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1000miles/configuration-files/master/README.md
```
